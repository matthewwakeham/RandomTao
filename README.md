# Random Tao (Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu)

Random Tao is a Python script which outputs a randomly selected chapter from the Tao Te Ching.

## Description

Random Tao is an attempt at exploring the intersection of philosophy and technology. The script is intended to be
an aid to those who wish to experience the roundabout logic of the Tao Te Ching online in a manner similar 
to its analog. A typical reading of the Tao often means flipping to a random chapter. Via the script a reader is presented
with a random chapter from the Tao. Such selections may be used for education or divination.
